## Synopsis
The Coronavirus has arrived in New York City! In order to prepare for the impending lockdown, you must diligently navigate through your neighborhood grocery store and grab all the essentials. But be careful, the virus is lurking in every isle, slowly drifting in the air and waiting to infect an unsuspecting customer, so proceed with caution!
## Gameplay
The goal of the game is to complete your shopping without getting infected by the virus.

The viruses are visible and will slowly float to you over the course of gameplay. If you idle too long, you risk getting infected. As its a first-person single player game, there is a limited visual field of view within the virtual space. Movement is also currently limited to front, back, left and right. When the player walks into the floating grocery items, they are added to the cart.

Once the cart is filled up, they will progress to the next level. If the virus touches the player before this task is complete, they lose the round and must start over.
